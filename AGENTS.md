# Gruppenreiseportal - Claude Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a specialized platform for organizing and booking travel for large groups (e.g., school classes, choirs, orchestras, sports teams). The system digitalizes and centralizes the complex logistical, financial, and safety-related tasks typically handled manually by group organizers.

**Core Purpose:** Enable group organizers (e.g., teachers) to plan trips, receive proposals from accommodation providers, manage automated split payments among group members, coordinate logistics, and ensure safety during travel - all through a centralized platform.

**Key Features:**
- **Request for Proposal System:** Organizers specify trip requirements (travelers, room configurations, special needs) and receive tailored offers from property managers
- **Automated Split Payments:** Individual payment links for each group member with installment options and automated tracking/reminders
- **Collaborative Trip Planning:** Live-updated itineraries, booking of additional services (buses, catering, activities)
- **Digital Document Management:** Electronic permission forms with legally-binding digital signatures
- **Safety & Communication:** Real-time group map, geofencing alerts, digital headcounts, SOS button, role-based communication channels

**User Roles:**
1. **Group Organizer:** Plans trips, manages requests for proposals, coordinates payments and logistics
2. **Large-Format Property Manager:** Reviews requests for proposals, submits offers, manages bookings
3. **Group Members:** Make payments, access trip information, use safety features
4. **Chaperones:** Monitor group during travel, use safety and communication tools
